# FINAL REPORT

## 8.0 Project system captured screen and explaination

### Login page
<img src="./images/login page.jpg" width="60%">

This screenshot captures the Login Page for the UNIMEAL web application. It serves as the primary gateway for existing users to access their accounts. The page is cleanly divided into two main sections:

1. __The Login Form__
   
   On your left is the login form, this is the functional part of the page, designed for user interaction:
   - __Credentials Input__: Standard fields are provided for the user to enter their email and password. The password field correctly masks the input for security.
   - __Convenience Features__: A "Remember me" checkbox is available to keep the user logged in, and a "Forgot Password?" link provides a way to recover a lost account.
   - __Primary Action__: The large pink "LOG IN" button is the main call-to-action for users to submit their credentials.
   - __User Role Distinction__: Crucially, the page provides two distinct paths for new users:
         - __Create an account__: This is for the primary user type, likely the students.
         - __Register as Vendor__: This separate button indicates that the system supports multiple user roles, allowing cafeteria owners (vendors) to register and access a different part                                     of the application (like their dashboard).

2. __Branding and Value Proposition__
   
   On the right is the brand and value proposition, this section communicates the application's identity and purpose:
     - __Slogan__: The catchy tagline, "Skip the Line, Not the Meal!!!", clearly and effectively communicates the core benefit of using UNIMEAL—convenience and time-saving.
     - __Logo__: The creative logo, featuring a burger wearing a graduation cap, cleverly targets its university student audience while representing its food-service nature.
     
     
### Registration Page
#### Student Registration Page
<img src="./images/register.jpg" width="60%">

     -  __Input Fields__: The form requests specific details from the student:
           -  __Student/Matric Number__ : This unique identifier is crucial for verifying the user as a student within the university system.
           -  __Name__: A standard field for the user's name or username.
           -  __Email Address__: Used for account verification, login, and receiving notifications.

           -  __Primary Action__: A prominent pink "REGISTER" button prompts the user to complete the process.
   
2. __Branding and Value Proposition__
   
   On the right is the brand and value proposition, this section communicates the application's identity and purpose:

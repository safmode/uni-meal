Food service is one of the important criteria for having a comfortable life as a university student. Throughout the time, the increasing number of students in IIUM had addressed the new problem of the efficiency and services of cafeteria food on the campus. Therefore, UniMeal is introduced to solve this problem. A redesigned web application called UniMeal gathers student orders for food and displays the menus from several cafeterias around IIUM. The main target audience of this web application is IIUM students and also the Mahallah Cafeteria.

# FINAL REPORT

## Project system captured screen and explaination

### Login page
<img src="./images/login page.jpg" width="60%">

This screenshot captures the Login Page for the UNIMEAL web application. It serves as the primary gateway for existing users to access their accounts. The page is cleanly divided into two main sections:

1. __The Login Form__
   
   On your left is the login form, this is the functional part of the page, designed for user interaction:
   - __Credentials Input__: Standard fields are provided for the user to enter their email and password. The password field correctly masks the input for security.
   - __Convenience Features__: A "Remember me" checkbox is available to keep the user logged in, and a "Forgot Password?" link provides a way to recover a lost account.
   - __Primary Action__: The large pink "LOG IN" button is the main call-to-action for users to submit their credentials.
   - __User Role Distinction__: Crucially, the page provides two distinct paths for new users:
         - __Create an account__: This is for the primary user type, likely the students.
         - __Register as Vendor__: This separate button indicates that the system supports multiple user roles, allowing cafeteria owners (vendors) to register and access a different part                                     of the application (like their dashboard).

2. __Branding and Value Proposition__
   
   On the right is the brand and value proposition, this section communicates the application's identity and purpose:
     - __Slogan__: The catchy tagline, "Skip the Line, Not the Meal!!!", clearly and effectively communicates the core benefit of using UNIMEAL—convenience and time-saving.
     - __Logo__: The creative logo, featuring a burger wearing a graduation cap, cleverly targets its university student audience while representing its food-service nature.
     
     
### Registration Page
#### Student Registration Page
<img src="./images/register.jpg" width="60%">

This screenshot shows the Student Registration Page for the UNIMEAL application. It is the entry point for new students who want to create an account. The page maintains a consistent two-column layout, similar to the login screen:

1. __The Registration Form__

   On the left side, the form is designed to collect the essential information needed to create a student      account:

     -  __Header__: It is clearly labeled "Create your Student Account" to avoid any confusion.
     -  __Input Fields__: The form requests specific details from the student:
           -  __Student/Matric Number__ : This unique identifier is crucial for verifying the user as a student within the university system.
           -  __Name__: A standard field for the user's name or username.
           -  __Email Address__: Used for account verification, login, and receiving notifications.
           -  __Password and Password Confirmation__: Two fields for the password ensure the user enters their intended password correctly, reducing errors.
           -  __Terms and Conditions__: An "Accept terms and conditions" checkbox is included, which is a standard practice for legal compliance and user agreement.
           -  __Primary Action__: A prominent pink "REGISTER" button prompts the user to complete the process.
   
2. __Branding and Value Proposition__
   
   On the right is the brand and value proposition, this section communicates the application's identity and purpose:
     - __Slogan__: The tagline "Skip the Line, Not the Meal!!!" is displayed again, connecting the registration process with the core benefit of the app.
     - __Logo__: The UNIMEAL logo with the graduation-cap-wearing burger is present, maintaining visual consistency and appeal to the target audience.


#### Vendor Registration Page
<img src="./images/Register vendor.png" width="60%">

This screenshot displays the Vendor Registration Page for the UNIMEAL platform. This is a dedicated portal for cafeteria owners or managers to create their business accounts, separate from the student users.


### Cafeteria & Menu Browsing Page
<img src="./images/hp1.jpg" width="60%">
<img src="./images/hp2.jpg" width="60%">

This composite image shows the Student Homepage / Dashboard of the UNIMEAL application, which is the main landing page a student sees after successfully logging in. It's designed to be a central hub for navigating the app's features.

1. The Welcome and Promotion Section
   This is the "above the fold" content, designed to welcome the user and present key information immediately.

   - __Personalized Header__: A warm greeting, "Welcome to UniMeal, Abduh," personalizes the experience and confirms the user is logged in. Essential action buttons, "Track My Orders" and "Logout," are prominently displayed for easy access.
   - __Hero Section__: This visually engaging area uses a large graphic and bold text to communicate the app's value proposition:
      - "UNIMEALING is more Personalised & Instant."
      - It also includes a call-to-action to download a mobile app from the App Store and Google Play, suggesting a broader ecosystem beyond the web application. The arrows on the sides indicate this might be a rotating carousel for promotions or features.

2. Food and Cafeteria Selection
   This section provides the core functionality, allowing the user to begin the ordering process.
   - __UniMeal Popular Categories__: This feature helps with food discovery by showcasing popular food types like Drinks, Pizza, Mee, Nasi, and Soup. It allows users to browse by food preference first, rather than by cafeteria, offering a flexible way to find what they want to eat.
   - __Select Your Mahallah Cafeteria__: This is the primary navigation hub of the application. It presents a clear, grid-based list of available cafeterias on campus such as Siddiq Cafeteria, Aminah Cafeteria, Ruqayyah Cafeteria and many more. Each cafeteria is represented by its official logo and name, making it easy for students to recognize and select their desired dining location to start ordering.

## What is the challenge/difficulties to develop the application

1. __System Integration Challenges__
      - Multiple user roles (student, vendor, admin) require separate dashboards and permissions.
      - Synchronizing modules (e.g. order → shipping → payment) needs careful planning to avoid data                mismatches or delays.
        
2. __Backend & Database Complexity__
      - Ensuring relational database structure is normalized and scalable.
      - Preventing data redundancy and maintaining consistency across modules.
        
3. __Security & Authentication__
      - Ensuring secure login/registration (especially for payment-related pages).
        
4. __User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)__
      - Making sure the UI is responsive across devices.
      - Ensuring the checkout flow is smooth (especially for payment).
      - Preventing user drop-off due to confusing layouts or form overload.
        
5. __Testing & Bug Fixing__
      - Testing all edge cases.
      - Ensuring form validations work as expected.
      - Testing across browsers and devices for layout consistency.
        
6. __Team Collaboration & Coordination__
      - Merging code and avoiding Git conflicts when multiple people are working simultaneously.
        
7. __Time & Resource Constraints__
      - Limited time to finish features for each team member.
      - Balancing between design, coding, and testing phases
